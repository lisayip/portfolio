        <p>Calthorpe has been operating since 1984 as a community garden centre offering various activities, educational closed loop eco garden with a cafe and football pitch on site. As a charity it functions on donations and volunteers but have been struggling to keep it operating lately. This year the cafe had to close to save on running costs which had greatly disappointed the local community who visits the garden regularly.   </p>
        
        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p>Having had several meetings and trying to understand the problems facing Calthorpe the pain points are highlighted below:   </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Lack of awareness from people passing by since the garden and grounds are hidden behind hedges and not clearly sign posted. </li>
            <li> Website does not clearly communicate all of the activities and programs available. </li>
            <li> Sports pitch, cafe and garden activities are under-utilised.  </li>
            <li>Not enough volunteers to help sustain the running of the centre and garden.</li>
            <li>Construction of a new centre for dementia and neurology research next door which may impact the centre and the local community with noise and pollution.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Solutions</h2>

        <p>After reviewing the website, talking to stakeholders and participating in user group interviews - I felt there are three avenues to focus on which should be addressed:  </p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Economic Sustainability:</b> Promote the cafe, sports pitch and room hire to allow Calthorpe to run more efficiently and economically with a simple booking and room hire system </li>
            <li> <b>Sustaining the local community:</b>  Create and organise activities specifically targeted to the local community, organisations and schools.</li>
            <li> <b> Communication :</b> Make the website more accessible, informative and inclusive - incorporating video and social media to draw in more volunteers and funding. It should be regularly updated with the latest news, events and activities to inform of what is happening in and around Calthorpe. </li>
            
        </ul>
